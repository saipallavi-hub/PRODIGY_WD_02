# ⏱️ Stopwatch Web Application

### 🛠️ Internship Task - Prodigy Tech Info
This project is developed as part of an internship task at **Prodigy Tech Info**. The task is to build an interactive and user-friendly **Stopwatch Web Application** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It supports basic time tracking functions including **Start**, **Pause**, **Reset**, and **Lap recording**.

## 📌 Features
- ▶️ **Start**: Begins or resumes the stopwatch.
- ⏸️ **Pause**: Stops time without resetting the value.
- 🔄 **Reset**: Resets the stopwatch to zero and clears lap times.
- 🕒 **Lap Tracking**: Records the current time as a lap without stopping the watch.
- ⌛ **Accurate Time Display**: Real-time minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, minimal, and responsive design.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Used for creating the structure of the stopwatch.
- **CSS3** – For styling the layout, buttons, and lap list.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Handles the timing logic, DOM manipulation, and interactivity.


## 🖥️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Use the controls to **start**, **pause**, **reset**, and record **lap times**.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
As part of this internship task, I learned how to:
- Use `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` for time-based logic
- Handle DOM updates in real time
- Create reusable JS functions for control buttons
- Design an intuitive and responsive stopwatch interface
- Manage and display dynamic lists (Lap times)
